This log is based on the paper that introduced the notion of
communicating FSMs (CFSMs) entitled "On Communicating Finite-State
Machines" by Daniel Brand and Pitro Zafiropulo in CACM 1983.

The log records a series of message interactions between a server and
a client. The trace is totally ordered, and is therefore broken up
into a server log file and a client log file.

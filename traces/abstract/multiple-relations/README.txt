This trace includes the test cases for closureIntoAndOutOfRegular 
disjointClosureAndRegularSubgraphs, and 
relationSubgraphIsolatedFromSpecialNodes.

I chose these traces since they include disjoint subgraphs, regular
relations closure relations, and a subgraph that is isolated from
both the INTIAL and TERMINAL nodes.

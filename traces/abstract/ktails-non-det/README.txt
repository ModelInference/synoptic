This example illustrates that kTails is a non-deterministic
algorithm. In the example, there are two possible models for k=2 --
one in which the a-b tails are merged, and another in which the b-a
tails are merged. Both tails cannot both be merged. Therefore, there
two possible models. The model that kTails will produce depends on the
merge that is performed first.

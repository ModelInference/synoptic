Voldemort implements a distributed hash table with a client API that
has two main methods: put(k,v) — associate the value v with the key k,
and get(k) — retrieve the current value associated with the key k. We
logged messages generated by client calls to the synchronized versions
of put and get and captured just the messages between the client and
the two replicas.

Provides basic data structures, such as graphs, transitions, and events.

<h3>Graphs</h3>

<p>
The main data-structure in Synoptic is a graph. In the implementation a graph is represented by a set of nodes.
Synoptic's graphs do not contain edges themselves, but leave it to the nodes to store the edges. 
Edges of nodes can be accessed via the interface <code>INode</code> which all classes 
representing nodes must implement. </p>

<p>There are two important classes that implement the interface <code>INode</code> and thus can be used to build graphs:
 <code>MessageEvent</code> and <code>Partition</code>. <code>MessageEvent</code> is used to build input graphs from raw data. 
 This class provides methods to add edges between different nodes of type <code>MessageEvent</code>. A typical input graph has type
  <code>Graph&lt;MessageEvent&gt;</code>. 
  
  </p><p>A <code>Partition</code> is a set of <code>MessageEvent</code>, and plays the role of a node in the <code>PartitionGraph</code>. 
  Partitions support merging and splitting of nodes, and do not store their edges explicitly. Thus they have no direct means of inserting an edge. 
  Instead, they generate edges implicitly and on the fly from the <code>MessageEvent</code>s they contain. This has the advantage that edges are
   always up-to-date and <code>MessageEvent</code>s can be moved freely among Partitions (as long as they are contained in at most one partition at every given time). </p>

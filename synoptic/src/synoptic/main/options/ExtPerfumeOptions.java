 * and populating instances of these options. All options can be exported to
 * AbstractOptions (the common options for all Synoptic projects) using
 * toAbstractOptions().

 * Options common between this class and SynopticOptions cannot be pushed up
 * into a superclass because plume-lib doesn't support inheritance.

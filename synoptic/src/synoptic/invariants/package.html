Provides implementation of invariants, and a specialized invariant set (<code>TemporalInvariantSet</code>).

<h3>Temporal Invariants</h3>

<p>Classes representing temporal invariants implement the interface <tt>TemporalInvariant</tt>.
The key class is <tt>TemporalInvariantSet</tt>, which represents a set of temporal invariants. <tt>TemporalInvariantSet.computeInvariants</tt> mines
temporal invariants from a graph. <tt>TemporalInvariantSet</tt> also provides members for checking invariants on a graph and,
if necessary, obtaining counter-examples. A description of the mining process can be found in <a href="/p/synoptic/wiki/TemporalInvariantMining">TemporalInvariantMining</a>.
</p>

<p>Temporal invariants are checked using an off-the-shelf model checker, with some preprocessing of the input graph.
The preprocessing is necessary because the model checker will find violating traces, such that a trace is a sequence of transition labels
and the traces that need to be obtained in the partition graph setting are sequences of state labels. Thus the partition graph must be
 transformed into a graph that contains, as transition label sequences, exactly the set of state label sequences of the partition graph.
 We need to prove the soundness of this process. The entry point to the model checking logic is <tt>TemporalInvariantSet.getViolations</tt>,
 which utilizes <tt>GraphLTLChecker</tt> </p>

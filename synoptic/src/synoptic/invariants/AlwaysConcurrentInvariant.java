/**
 * Represents the "x is always concurrent with y" invariant for some two
 * distributed event types x and y. What this means is that for all the inputs
 * traces to Synoptic:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * 1) There was at least one trace in which x and y co-appeared.
 * 2) In all traces in which x and y co-appeared the predicate (x < y) and the
 *    predicate (x > y) were both false. These two statements basically say that
 *    x and y were never ordered.

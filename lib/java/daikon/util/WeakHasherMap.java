// The purpose of this class is to be used by Intern.java.  It is difficult

/**
 * This is a modified version of @see{WeakHashMap} from JDK 1.2.2.
 * The modification adds a constructor that takes a Hasher argument.
 * I also replaced uses of hashCode() and equals() by uses of Hasher,
 * where appropriate.
 * I've changed the name so that this version is not used accidentally.
 * It is slightly less efficient, in the absence of a Hasher, and has
 * not been as extensively tested.<p>
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * A hashtable-based <code>Map</code> implementation with <em>weak keys</em>.
 * An entry in a <code>WeakHashMap</code> will automatically be removed when
 * its key is no longer in ordinary use.  More precisely, the presence of a
 * mapping for a given key will not prevent the key from being discarded by the
 * garbage collector, that is, made finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed.
 * When a key has been discarded its entry is effectively removed from the map,
 * so this class behaves somewhat differently than other <code>Map</code>
 * implementations.
 *
 * <p> Both null values and the null key are supported.  This class has
 * performance characteristics similar to those of the <code>HashMap</code>
 * class, and has the same efficiency parameters of <em>initial capacity</em>
 * and <em>load factor</em>.
 *
 * <p> Like most collection classes, this class is not synchronized.  A
 * synchronized <code>WeakHashMap</code> may be constructed using the
 * <code>Collections.synchronizedMap</code> method.
 *
 * <p> This class is intended primarily for use with key objects whose
 * <code>equals</code> methods test for object identity using the
 * <code>==</code> operator.  Once such a key is discarded it can never be
 * recreated, so it is impossible to do a lookup of that key in a
 * <code>WeakHashMap</code> at some later time and be surprised that its entry
 * has been removed.  This class will work perfectly well with key objects
 * whose <code>equals</code> methods are not based upon object identity, such
 * as <code>String</code> instances.  With such recreatable key objects,
 * however, the automatic removal of <code>WeakHashMap</code> entries whose
 * keys have been discarded may prove to be confusing.
 *
 * <p> The behavior of the <code>WeakHashMap</code> class depends in part upon
 * the actions of the garbage collector, so several familiar (though not
 * required) <code>Map</code> invariants do not hold for this class.  Because
 * the garbage collector may discard keys at any time, a
 * <code>WeakHashMap</code> may behave as though an unknown thread is silently
 * removing entries.  In particular, even if you synchronize on a
 * <code>WeakHashMap</code> instance and invoke none of its mutator methods, it
 * is possible for the <code>size</code> method to return smaller values over
 * time, for the <code>isEmpty</code> method to return <code>false</code> and
 * then <code>true</code>, for the <code>containsKey</code> method to return
 * <code>true</code> and later <code>false</code> for a given key, for the
 * <code>get</code> method to return a value for a given key but later return
 * <code>null</code>, for the <code>put</code> method to return
 * <code>null</code> and the <code>remove</code> method to return
 * <code>false</code> for a key that previously appeared to be in the map, and
 * for successive examinations of the key set, the value set, and the entry set
 * to yield successively smaller numbers of elements.
 *
 * <p> Each key object in a <code>WeakHashMap</code> is stored indirectly as
 * the referent of a weak reference.  Therefore a key will automatically be
 * removed only after the weak references to it, both inside and outside of the
 * map, have been cleared by the garbage collector.
 *
 * <p> <strong>Implementation note:</strong> The value objects in a
 * <code>WeakHashMap</code> are held by ordinary strong references.  Thus care
 * should be taken to ensure that value objects do not strongly refer to their
 * own keys, either directly or indirectly, since that will prevent the keys
 * from being discarded.  Note that a value object may refer indirectly to its
 * key via the <code>WeakHashMap</code> itself; that is, a value object may
 * strongly refer to some other key object whose associated value object, in
 * turn, strongly refers to the key of the first value object.  This problem
 * may be fixed in a future release.

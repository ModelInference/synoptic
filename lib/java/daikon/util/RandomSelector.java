/**
 *
 * <b>RandomSelector</b> selects k elements uniformly at random from
 * an iteration over n elements using only O(k) space instead of O(n)
 * space.  For example, selecting 1 element from a FileStream
 * containing 1000 elements will take O(1) space. The class takes as
 * input the number k during initialization and then can accept() any
 * number of Objects in the future.  At any point in time, getValues()
 * will either return k randomly selected elements from the elements
 * previous accepted or if accept() was called fewer than k times, will
 * return all elements previously accepted.
 *
 * <p>The random selection is independent between every constructed
 * instance of RandomSelector objects, but for the same instance,
 * multiple calls to getValues() are not independent. Making two calls
 * to consecutive getValues() without an accept() in between will
 * return two new Lists containing the same elements.
 *
 * <p>A second mode allows for a fixed probability of randomly keeping
 *  each item as opposed to a fixed number of samples.
 *
 * <P>SPECFIELDS:
 * <BR>current_values  : Set : The values chosen based on the Objects observed
 * <BR>number_observed : int : The number of Objects observed
 * <BR>number_to_take  : int : The number of elements to choose ('k' above)
 * <BR>keep_probability: double :  The percentage of elements to keep
 * <BR>selector_mode :
 *       {FIXED,PERCENT}  : either fixed amount of samples or fixed percent.
 *
 * <P>Example use:
 * <BR> // randomly selects 100 lines of text from a file
 * <pre>
 *  List selectedLines = null;
 *  try {
 *     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader
 *       (new FileReader ("myfile.txt"));
 *     RandomSelector selector = new RandomSelector (100);
 *     while (br.ready()) {
 *       selector.accept (br.readLine());
 *     }
 *     selectedLines = selector.getValues();
 *   }
 *   catch (IOException e2) { e2.printStackTrace(); }
 * </pre>

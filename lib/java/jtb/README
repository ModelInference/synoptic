The files in this directory were generated using JTB 1.3.2 (the Java
Tree Builder; look for "java jtb" in google) and javacc (version 3.2),
as follows:

  cd ${INV}/java/jtb

  java -classpath ~/jtb/jtb132.jar:$CLASSPATH EDU.purdue.jtb.JTB -pp -tk -p jtb -printer Java1.5.jj 

  javacc jtb.out.jj 

  fix package name of files generated by javacc

  cp Token.java.modified Token.java

  cd ${INV}/java

  find ./jtb -name "*.java" | xargs javac

  manually modified some files to suit my needs. All modifications are commented and have the
  name "Carlos Pacheco" in the comments (so you can search for them).

  copied over boilerplate Makefiles from ${INV}/java/daikon into subdirectories.

The file "Token.java.modified" was obtained from the javaCC CVS
repository (under javacc/examples/JavaGrammars/1.5; version 1.1 of the
file). The file Java1.5.jj is from the same above repository (version
1.3 of the file), modified slightly by Jens Palsberg to work with JTB.

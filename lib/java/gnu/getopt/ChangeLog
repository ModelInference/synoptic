For release 1.9.9 (2002/01/16)

Yasuoka Masahiko <yasuoka@yasuoka.net> provided Japanese langauge messages.

Csom Gyula <Csom@interface.hu> provided Hungarian languag messages.

Guillaume Rousse <rousse@ccr.jussieu.fr> supplied the ant build file
and documentation.  

For release 1.0.8 (2000/09/11)

Ernst de Haan <ernst@jollem.com> provided Dutch language messages.

For release 1.0.7 (2000/02/02)

Fixed an obscure POSIX compatibility issue.  When an optstring is "o:",
then "-o -- foo" should result in -o having an optarg of "foo", not "--"
as was previously returned.  This new parsing behavior is only enabled
in POSIX compatibility mode.  Thank to Don Suit (dsuit@fc.hp.com) for
reporting this and help in communicating proper POSIX behavior.

For release 1.0.6 (1999/06/27)

Added French language messages.  Thanks to Edouard G. Parmelan 
(Edouard.Parmelan@quadratec.fr) for this contribution.

For release 1.0.5 (1999/03/23)

Fixed bug that caused getopt to throw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
when an empty string ("") argument was encountered.  Thanks to 
Steffen Siebert (siebert@logware.de) for this bug report and a patch.

For release 1.0.4

Added Norwegian language messages.  Thanks to Bjørn-Ove Heimsund 
(s811@drone.ii.uib.no) for this contribution.

For release 1.0.3

Added German language messages.  Thanks to Bernhard Bablok 
(bablokb@gmx.net) for this contribution.

For release 1.0.2

Prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception if "optstring" is null.  David Karr
(dkarr@nmo.gtegsc.com) had a problem with this when commenting out options
during debugging, so I have fixed it.

For release 1.0.1

Added Czech language messages.  Thanks to Roman Szturc (Roman.Szturc@vsb.cz)
for this contribution.

For release 1.0

No changes.  Just increment release number to 1.0

For release 0.9.2

The sample code has been moved into a separate file called "GetoptDemo.java".
This is so that it can be legally placed into the public domain and not
subsumed into the LGPL as would be the case if it were in Getopt.java.
While I do not encourage anyone to write proprietary software, I feel that
there is no good purpose served in restricting what someone can do with
a short example program.

Modified the Makefile and various other files to support the change
above.

For release 0.9.1

This release contains only minor fixes.  It's always possible it introduces
some bugs though so unless you are keen on internationalization or are
having a line separator problem, there is no need to upgrade from 0.9.

-- Messages are now internationalized.  Thanks to Bill King 
   (wrking@eng.sun.com) for this.

-- Changes all print's to println's to avoid system dependent line
   separators.

-- All internal variables are now protected.  Several people suggested
   doing this in response to my request for comments in the help file.
   No one suggested keeping any variables public.

-- Fixed parts of licensing that mentioned the regular GPL.  Getopt is
   and always has been licensed under the LPGL.  Thanks to Arieh Markel 
   (arieh.markel@sun.com) for pointing this out.

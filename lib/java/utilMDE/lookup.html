Lookup searches a set of files for information.  The user specifies
 a set of keywords (or regular expressions), and Lookup outputs each
 entry that matches the keywords.  In the simplest case, Lookup
 prints each paragraph (in any of the files) that contains all the
 keywords. <p>

 A file can contain one or more entries.  A short entry is a single
 paragraph (delimited from the next entry by a blank line).  A long
 entry is introduced by a line that begins with '&gt;entry'.  The
 remainder of that line is a one line description of the entry.  A
 long entry is terminated by '&lt;entry', by the start of a new long
 entry, or by the start of a new file. <p>

 Lookup searches for the keywords in the body of short entries and
 in the one-line description of long entries.  An entry matches if
 it contains all of the keywords.  If multiple entries match, the
 first line of each is printed.  If only one entry matches, then
 that entry is printed in its entirety. <p>

 By default, Lookup searches the file ~/lookup/root.  Files can
 contain comments and can include other files.  Comments start with
 a % sign in the first column.  Any comment line is ignored (it is
 not treated as a blank line for the purpose of separating entries).
 A file can include another file via a line of the form
 '\include{filename}'. <p>
<p>Command line options: <p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>-h --help=&lt;boolean></b>. Show detailed help information and exit. [default false]<p>
  <li> <b>-f --entry-file=&lt;string></b>. Specify the search list for the file that contains information to
 be searched.  Only the first file found is used.  Files are separated
 by colons (:). [default ~/lookup/root]<p>
  <li> <b>-b --search-body=&lt;boolean></b>. Search the body of long entries in addition to the entry's
 description.  The bodies of short entries are always searched. [default false]<p>
  <li> <b>-e --regular-expressions=&lt;boolean></b>. Specifies that keywords are regular expressions.  If false, keywords
 are text matches. [default false]<p>
  <li> <b>-c --case-sensitive=&lt;boolean></b>. If true, keywords matching is case sensistive.  By default both
 regular expressions and text keywords are case insensitive. [default false]<p>
  <li> <b>-w --word-match=&lt;boolean></b>. If true, match a text keyword only as a separate word, not as a
 substring of a word.  This option is ignored if
 regular_expressions is true. [default false]<p>
  <li> <b>-a --print-all=&lt;boolean></b>. By default, if multiple entries are matched, only a synopsis
 of each entry is printed.  If 'print_all' is selected then
 the body of each matching entry is printed. [default false]<p>
  <li> <b>-i --item-num=&lt;integer></b>. Specifies which item to print when there are multiple matches. [no default]<p>
  <li> <b>-l --show-location=&lt;boolean></b>. If true, show the filename/line number of each matching entry
 in the output. [default false]<p>
  <li> <b>-v --verbose=&lt;boolean></b>.  [default false]<p>
  <li> <b>--entry-start-re=&lt;regex></b>.  [default ^>entry *()]<p>
  <li> <b>--entry-stop-re=&lt;regex></b>.  [default ^<entry]<p>
  <li> <b>--description-re=&lt;regex></b>.  [no default]<p>
  <li> <b>--comment-re=&lt;string></b>.  [default ^%.*]<p>
  <li> <b>--include-re=&lt;string></b>.  [default \\include\{(.*)\}]<p>

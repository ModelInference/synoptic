This package, utilMDE, is intended to supplement java.util.
It provides general funcionality, not specific to any particular client.
For documentation, see the doc/ subdirectory.

This package includes modified versions of code from the Java 2 SDK, such
as those for hashing.  (I've renamed classes so they won't be used
accidentally and won't conflict with other classes of the same name.)
My understanding of the Java 2 SDK License is:
  * I can distribute modified executables to anyone for
    research use.  [3.1 (d) (ii)]
  * I can distribute modified source to other licensees (only).
    [3.1 (d) (i)]
  * I can re-use the JDK's names if I choose, but only for modified
    versions of the original code of those names.  [3.1 (d) (iii)]

I have tried a few times to update WeakHasherMap to a more recent version
of the JDK, but failed.  It should probably be left as is.

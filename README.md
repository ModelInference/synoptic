# Overview #

This site hosts source code, academic papers, and other resources for three related projects:

  * **Synoptic** : a tool to infer an FSM model from a sequential log.
  * **CSight** : a tool to infer a communicating FSM model from a distributed system's logs
  * **InvariMint** : an approach to declaratively specify model inference algorithms
  * **Perfume** : a tool to infer performance models from system logs. 

# Introduction #

Systems are often difficult to debug and to understand. A typical way of gaining insight into system behavior is by inspecting execution logs. However, manual log analysis is often tedious and labor-intensive. Synoptic and CSight are tools that mine a model of the system that generated the log, thereby simplifying log analysis.

  * **Synoptic** mines a finite state machine (FSM) model representations of a **sequential** system from its logs. Two features distinguish Synoptic from other tools.
    1. Synoptic's models preserve key event ordering invariants mined from the log, making them more accurate.
    1. Synoptic uses refinement to derive the model, which is more efficient than traditional coarsening algorithms like kTails.

  * **CSight** mines a communicating FSM model to represent the **distributed** system that generated a set of logs. Like Synoptic, CSight mines models that preserve temporal properties of the system.

  * **InvariMint** is an approach to express FSM model inference algorithms in a common framework. The key idea is to encode properties of an algorithms as finite state machines. These properties can then be instantiated for a specific input log of observations and combined to generate/infer a model that describes the observations.

  * **Perfume** extends Synoptic to account for resource utilization information often available in system logs. Perfume-generated models are FSM models with resource information annotating the event transitions. The algorithm extends trivially to arbitrary integer-valued resources, such as time, memory utilization, network throughput, etc. Perfume mines temporal properties with performance constraints from the log and uses these properties to identify and remove imprecise generalizations in the Synoptic model inference process.

# A synoptic example #

<b>1.</b> Lets say you are implementing the [two phase commit protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol). You wrote your code, and as part of debugging you included print statements that output a log like the following:

```
src : 2, dst : 0, timestamp : 16, type : propose, txid : 1
src : 2, dst : 1, timestamp : 17, type : propose, txid : 1
src : 0, dst : 2, timestamp : 18, type : abort, txid : 1
src : 1, dst : 2, timestamp : 19, type : commit, txid : 1
src : 2, dst : 0, timestamp : 20, type : tx_abort, txid : 1
src : 2, dst : 1, timestamp : 21, type : tx_abort, txid : 1
..
```


---


<b>2.</b> You then thoroughly tested and debugged the code, and eventually deployed it. After a week of executing thousands of two-phase commit rounds you discover an application-level inconsistency. This leads you to look at the accumulated log:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ModelInference/synoptic/images/main_page/long_2pc_log.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ModelInference/synoptic/images/main_page/long_2pc_log.png)


---


<b>3.</b> Uh oh. Your first challenge -- to make sense of the thousands of lines in front of you. Your second challenge -- find clues that might lead you to a potential root cause. You fire up Synoptic with:

```
$ ./synoptic.sh -r '.+ timestamp :(?<DTIME>), type :(?<TYPE>), txid :(?<txId>)' -m '\k<txId>' logfile.txt -o twopc-graph
```

And you get the following output:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ModelInference/synoptic/images/main_page/2pc_new_graph.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ModelInference/synoptic/images/main_page/2pc_new_graph.png)


---


<b>4.</b> You realize that this graph output differs from the graph that you generated while testing your code:

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ModelInference/synoptic/images/main_page/2pc_old_new_graphs.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ModelInference/synoptic/images/main_page/2pc_old_new_graphs.png)

You then find exactly where this discrepancy occurs in the log file, and go on from there.
